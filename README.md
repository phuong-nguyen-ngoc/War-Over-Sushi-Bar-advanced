# War-Over-Sushi-Bar
A fighting game developed for computer game design course. This is the 2-computer version - an online version that does not require Internet connection. It uses LCM for networking between 2 computers. This version is more fun because from certain level, what a player sees is different from one another. For 1-computer version, please check out War-Over-Sushi-Bar-normal repository.

To play the 2-computer version, please install LCM on your computer. Here is the link on how to download and build https://lcm-proj.github.io
Regardless of the version, You need to install pygame. Also, please download all files in this repository because the program will not run if there are graphic files missing.

On 1 computer, run the server.py file and client2.py file. This computer will play as player 1. On another computer, run client1.py. This computer will play as player 2. Make sure that you run the server file before you run any client file. On the start screen, click the box with the question mark for tutorial and the box with the human symbol for credit. Click start to join the game.

Have fun!
